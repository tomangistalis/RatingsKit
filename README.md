## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate RatingsKit into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/RatingsKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Or add it directly via Xcode's Package Manager integration.

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```swift
import SwiftUI
import RatingsKit

struct RatingsView: View {
    var body: some View {
        RatingRequestScreen(
            appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
            appRatingProvider: YourAppRatingProvider(),
            requestedRatingAction: {
                // Handle when user has requested to leave a rating
                print("User tapped to leave a rating")
            },
            maybeLaterAction: {
                // Handle when user decides to rate later
                print("User will rate later")
            },
            onError: { error in
                // Handle any errors that occur
                print("Error occurred: \(error)")
            }
        )
    }
}
```

### Creating a Custom Rating Provider

Implement the `AppRatingProviding` protocol to fetch ratings and reviews from your backend service:

```swift
struct YourAppRatingProvider: AppRatingProviding {
    func fetch() async throws -> AppRatingResponse {
        // Implement your logic to fetch ratings from your backend
        // For example:
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: yourBackendURL)
        return try JSONDecoder().decode(AppRatingResponse.self, from: data)
    }
}
```

### Using the Mock Provider

RatingsKit comes with a `MockAppRatingProvider` for testing and UI development:

```swift
RatingRequestScreen(
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
    appRatingProvider: MockAppRatingProvider.withMockReviews
)
```

Available mock configurations:
- `.withMockReviews`: Provides a set of sample reviews
- `.noReviews`: Shows ratings without reviews
- `.noRatingsOrReviews`: Empty state with no ratings or reviews
- `.throwsError`: Simulates an error state

### Using with Supabase and App Store Connect API

For detailed instructions on how to create a Supabase Edge Function that fetches data from the App Store Connect API for use with RatingsKit, see our [Supabase Implementation Guide](SUPABASE-GUIDE.md).

## Customization

RatingsKit's UI is built with SwiftUI and follows system styling, making it blend seamlessly with your app. The interface automatically adapts to light and dark mode and respects system accessibility settings.
